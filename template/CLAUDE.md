# CLAUDE.md — [PROJECT NAME] Project Instructions

> OS-level instructions (session protocol, beads workflow, model routing, blog pipeline, rules) are inherited from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. This file contains only project-specific configuration.

## Project

**[PROJECT NAME]**: [One-line description of what this project is.]

## Agent Roster

The PM agent coordinates work across specialized agents. Each has a spec in `docs/`.

| Agent | Spec | Container | Role |
|-------|------|-----------|------|
| PM | CLAUDE.md | (beads via OS) | Prioritize, track, route work |
| [Agent Name] | docs/agent-[name].md | [service name] | [Role description] |

**Routing rules:**
- [Task type] → [Agent Name]
- Everything else (prioritization, decisions, coordination) → PM

## Task-Type → Model Mapping

| Task Type | Model | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| [Novel design / architecture] | **Opus** | [Why this needs the strongest model] |
| [Structured analysis / specs] | **Sonnet** | [Why mid-tier is sufficient] |
| [Mechanical updates / templates] | **Haiku** | [Why cheap model works] |

## Design Change Cascade

**Every design/architecture change MUST trigger these downstream beads:**

A "design change" is any bead that modifies:
- [Define what counts as a design change in this project]

```
Design Change (parent)
├── 1. [Review Type] (P1, blocked by parent)
│      Route to: [Agent]
│      Assess: [What to check]
│      Output: [What it produces]
│
├── 2. [Review Type] (P2, blocked by #1)
│      Route to: [Agent]
│      ...
│
└── N. [Final Check] (P3, blocked by #N-1)
       Route to: [Agent]
       ...
```

## Source of Truth Hierarchy

When artifacts disagree, resolve conflicts in this order:

1. **[Highest authority]** — [Why this wins]
2. **[Second authority]** — [Its relationship to #1]
3. **[Third authority]** — [Its relationship to #2]
4. **[Derived artifact]** — this synthesizes everything; it follows, never leads

## Artifact Conventions

- **[Artifact type]**: [Format and location]
- **Specs and plans**: Structured markdown in `docs/`.
- **Code**: In appropriate source directories, tracked by beads when relevant.

All artifacts in `docs/` should be linked from a corresponding bead so nothing gets lost.
