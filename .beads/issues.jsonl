Commit 7e1ee8d. Artifacts: docker/ (Dockerfile.beads, Dockerfile.gh, docker-compose.yml), bin/ (bd, gh wrappers with readlink self-resolution), claude/CLAUDE.md (OS-level instructions), template/ (project skeleton with BOOTSTRAP.md, agent specs, blog pipeline), setup.sh, new-project.sh."}

BOOTSTRAP.md becomes Claude-facing instructions that guide an interactive bootstrap conversation.

Three files changed: (1) new-project.sh — next steps now say 'claude' instead of manual vi editing. (2) template/CLAUDE.md — added HTML comment that triggers bootstrap detection when placeholders are present. (3) template/BOOTSTRAP.md — rewritten as Claude-facing instructions: 9 sections walked interactively, answers applied immediately to CLAUDE.md and agent specs, finalize step cleans up. Forward-only: no impact on existing projects."}
